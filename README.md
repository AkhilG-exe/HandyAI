ASL Translation Project is a web-based application that recognizes American Sign Language hand signs via webcam, maps gestures to corresponding text and speech, and provides real-time visual feedback. It uses computer vision and gesture recognition to assist communication, language learning, and accessibility for Deaf and hard-of-hearing users. Just something I wanted to recreate!
